## Audio Visualization

![Audio Visualization](images/audiovis.png)

An audio visualizer with FFT analysis and shader rendering.

Written in C++ with [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) and GLSL. The shader uses a ray marching algorithm to render geometric primitives.

### Raycaster in a maze

![Raycaster](images/raycaster.png)

A simulated 3D environment with raycasting in a 2D randomly generated maze.
Using a fixed number of raycasts it determines the distance of walls from the player and draws them accordingly.

The maze is generated with the recursive backtracking algorithm and then converted to a format suitable for the renderer.

The raycaster subsystem is a partial port from http://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/

### Software Renderer

![Renderer](images/renderer.png)

A simple 3D renderer for a set of points using transformation matrices and perspective projection.
It doesn't use OpenGL functions, instead it calculates through matrix operations the final positions of 3D vertices to a 2D scene.

### Space Shooter

![Space Shooter](images/spaceshooter.png)

A top-down space shooter with physics and dynamic steering behaviours.
It uses simple physics integration with movement governed by AI modifying linear and angular accelerations.
