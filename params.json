The shader uses a ray marching algorithm to render geometric primitives.\r\n\r\n[[Source](https://github.com/agilul/audio-visualization), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYk8sEuPvlk)]\r\n\r\n## Love2D Demos\r\n\r\nAll demos are written in Lua with [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10.1.\r\n\r\n### Raycaster in a maze\r\n\r\n![Raycaster](images/raycaster.png)\r\n\r\nA simulated 3D environment with raycasting in a 2D randomly generated maze.\r\nUsing a fixed number of raycasts it determines the distance of walls from the player and draws them accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe maze is generated with the recursive backtracking algorithm and then converted to a format suitable for the renderer.\r\n\r\nThe raycaster subsystem is a partial port from http://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/\r\n\r\n[[Source](https://github.com/agilul/raycaster-maze-love2d), [GIF](images/raycaster.gif)]\r\n\r\n### Software Renderer\r\n\r\n![Renderer](images/renderer.png)\r\n\r\nA simple 3D renderer for a set of points using transformation matrices and perspective projection.\r\nIt doesn't use OpenGL functions, instead it calculates through matrix operations the final positions of 3D vertices to a 2D scene.\r\n\r\n[[Source](https://github.com/agilul/software-renderer-love2d), [GIF](images/renderer.gif)]\r\n\r\n### Space Shooter\r\n\r\n![Space Shooter](images/spaceshooter.png)\r\n\r\nA top-down space shooter with physics and dynamic steering behaviours.\r\nIt uses simple physics integration with movement governed by AI modifying linear and angular accelerations.\r\n\r\nHelper libraries in lib/ from http://hump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\r\n\r\n[[Source](https://github.com/agilul/spaceshooter-love2d), [GIF](images/spaceshooter.gif)]",
